                Welcome! My name is Carolyn Coyle, a Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate Degree Program
                in Ecology, housed in the Fish, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology Department at
                Colorado State University.
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>
                My research centers on plant-animal interactions, with a special focus on songbirds
                as potential pollinators. With interests that span conservation biology,
                ornithology, and pollination ecology, I have developed a deep passion for
                understanding how birds contribute to ecosystem health, and a curiosity on how this
                may shift across urban gradients.
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>
                As a dedicated conservation biologist and advocate for mental health in academia, I
                seek to blend rigorous science with community engagement, ensuring that my research
                has both local and global impact. Currently, I am seeking postdoctoral opportunities
                where I can apply my expertise in plant-animal interactions, bird ecology and
                conservation, and participatory science. I also bring experience with ecological
                modeling and spatial ecology and seek to strengthen those skills as a postdoctoral
                fellow.
