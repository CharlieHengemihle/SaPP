              Conducted under PI Dr. Liba Pejchar, in collaboration with Dr. Caitlin Wells, Teia

              Partnering with the Institute for Bird Populations (IBP) Monitoring Avian Production
              and Survival (MAPS) stations, as well as independent banding groups, we received
              pollen swabs from thousands of birds across the western U.S. and British Columbia.

              <strong>Bird Characteristics & Pollen:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  What individual bird traits (e.g., sex, age) or environmental factors (e.g., date
                  of first flowering) are linked to the presence of pollen on songbirds?

              <strong>Flower Characteristics & Bird Preferences:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Are particular plant morphological characteristics (e.g., flower color, shape)
                  associated with a higher probability of flower-foraging and pollen-carrying by
                  songbirds? (Image 1 (pic 3) | Image 2 (pic 2))

              <strong>Species Richness & Network Redundancy:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Does species richness or the relative abundance of functional groups (songbirds
                  vs. hummingbirds) contribute to network indices associated with redundancy, in
                  bird-flower networks?
